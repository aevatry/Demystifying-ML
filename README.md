# Demystifying-ML

This is a project for the IExplore module Demistifying Machine Learning  \
The project is to classify videos between drowsy and not drowsy using feature extraction and a LSTM 

Originally the project looked something like the diagrams underneath but after consideration, we change the project to extract feature manually and then have a LSTM
